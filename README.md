# FilecoinGreen-tools
Tools we need to build and are building in order to track, reduce and mitigate environmental impacts in Filecoin and beyond

# Welcome to the Filecoin Green project idea repo!
As we are building tools to track environmental attributes throughout the Filecoin ecosystem - and throughout Web3 more broadly - we want to know your thoughts and ideas. What needs to be built in this space? How can we create a world in which environmental impacts are traced through every online action? How can we support Filecoin and other networks in a journey to become verifiably net environmentally beneficial? How can we harness Defi and other parts of Web3 to verifiably channel resources towards environmental causes? And of course, how can we use Filecoin to store all the data associated with this?

# The goals of Filecoin Green
Filecoin Green aims to build open-source technologies within our ecosystem that will allow Filecoin to become verifiably net environmentally beneficial, and in the process allow tracking of environmental impacts throughout Filecoin, other chains, Web3 more generally, and beyond. The scope of 'environmental impacts' is intentionally broad, including not only electricity use but also embodied emissions in hardware and the environmental impacts of mining. We believe that the verifiability and interoperability of Web3 datastructures lend themselves naturally to rigorously evaluating upstream environmental effects throughout a value chain, and that building these tools now will enable us to substantially reduce and mitigate these impacts throughout the future world economy.

In the near-term the focus of Filecoin Green is to provide tools making easy to estimate, reduce, and mitigate the environmental impacts of Filecoin, beginning with electricity use and consequent carbon emissions.

# In the future
Protocol Labs wants to support ideas in this space! We are planning events, grants and other support to enable Filecoin to become verifiably environmentally beneficial and to track environmental impacts throughout the web.
