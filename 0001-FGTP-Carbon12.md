## Title
[Carbon12](https://github.com/mjohnson518/Carbon12)

## Abstract
The aim of the project is to leverage the web3 tech stack to showcase how we can track and trace embodied emissions through industrial supply chains.

## Status

Active - Please see the [Carbon12 Repo here](https://github.com/mjohnson518/Carbon12). For additional info, please check out the [Chainshot Forum post here](https://forum.chainshot.com/t/carbon12-final-project/57).

## What is the goal
This project is relevant because around the World today, the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions that originate from industrial supply chains go largely unaccounted for. When they are measured, the calculations are based only on averages and estimates, rather than actual activity-level data. Whats needed is a solution to comprehensively track and trace the emissions associated with operations to create transparency and unequivocal accountability over industrial supply chain emissions.

## What are the inputs
This tool should incentivize industrial actors to report activity-level (primary) data on the emissions associated with their operations. 

## What are the outputs
The key output of this tool will be environmental product declarations that comprenhensively account for the embodied emissions associated with the entire production of the product - from extraction of raw materials all the way to the finished good.

## Proposed Solution
An open-source architecture that supply chain actors can use to define, track, and trace emissions, as well as report disclosures. By designing a solution that comprehensively and verifiably tracks supply chain emissions, this system could also enable the trade of differentiated commodities (i.e., physical goods + digital attributes) and associated credit certificates (carbon offsets and insets)
